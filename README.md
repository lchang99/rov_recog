1. Video Feed
	Calibrate (underwater) - Distortion, Ball color
	How many frames are we analyzing per second?
2. Detection
	Contours vs Hough transforms
		Hough (somewhat written) - How to change parameters according to circle size
			Algorithm? Deep Learning model?
		Contours (not written) - Bypass the changing circle size by just recognizing circular obects insetad of 					 trying to find circles
	LONG TERM: Use tracking and detection
3. Distance calculation
4. Write distance to a file
